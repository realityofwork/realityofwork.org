## Manifesto
Here is an offer of futuristic principles in response to how we work today which can help us reconsider how we approach it tomorrow.

### 1. Individual wellbeing over business needs.

### 2. Work-life boundaries over work-life balance.

### 3. Human needs are messy.

### 4. An individual is valued by the roles they play, not by the time they spend.

### 5. Hiring someone is a significant responsibility.
